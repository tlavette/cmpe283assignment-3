The following was the overall effort dynamic placed in the completion of this assignment. We met and collaborated on the strategy and each one of us had point lead for the bulleted items, however, we spent much time collaborating via Zoom in peer configuration and code triage. We also spent time engaging in knowledge transfer as each item had slightly different requirements and needs for ultimate completion.

**Tonja Jean**

* Confirmed the VM module and kernel were successfully running. 

* Performed a collaborative review of the requirements to determine the resources needed to complete for assignment-3. 

* Performed code update of CPUID leaf node %eax=0x4FFFFFFC 

* Modified the cupid.c and vmx.c programs for calculating the  count of cpu cycles for a specific exit when eax=0x4FFFFFFC

* Re-Built kernel module after the code changes. 

* Test and debug Collaboration 

* Performed final code refactoring and compilation. 

* Collect and compile documentation.
