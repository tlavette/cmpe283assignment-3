The following was the overall effort dynamic placed in the completion of this assignment. We met and collaborated on the strategy and each one of us had point lead for the bulleted items, however, we spent much time collaborating via Zoom in peer configuration and code triage. We also spent time engaging in knowledge transfer as each item had slightly different requirements and needs for ultimate completion.
